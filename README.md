# Cyber Security Journey 


Hello, my name is Gian LaManno and I am currently attending SecureSet a Cybersecurity Bootcamp in Denver, Colorado 
I went to school and got a bachelors in Advertising and Marketing and though I have a very creative outlook in thinking I 
also am very analytical.  I have always been facinated in the research especially in understanding the mind of the consumer and I hope I can 
use that same motivation and mind set to problem solve and accomplish goals in the field of cybersecurity.
